# STEM Bridge Security Checklist âœ…

## Database Security
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- [x] Profiles table: Users can only read/update their own profile
- [x] Site content table: Only admins can modify, everyone can read
- [x] Admin verification through server-side API only
- [x] Service role restricted to profile creation only

## Authentication Security
- [x] Admin-only signup with server-side invite code verification
- [x] Invite code stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- [x] No automatic profile creation triggers
- [x] Email confirmation bypassed for smoother admin flow
- [x] Session-based authentication through Supabase Auth

## API Security
- [x] Admin verification endpoint uses server-side Supabase client
- [x] Invite code validation happens server-side only
- [x] No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- [x] Service role key only used in server-side API routes

## Client-Side Security
- [x] No console.log statements with sensitive data in production code
- [x] Admin status checked against database profiles table
- [x] Content editing restricted to verified admins only
- [x] Real-time subscriptions properly scoped to content changes
- [x] Fallback to localStorage only for non-sensitive display content

## Environment Security
- [x] All sensitive keys in .env file (not committed to git)
- [x] Service role key properly protected
- [x] Admin invite code configurable via environment
- [x] Supabase credentials properly configured

## Production Readiness
- [x] Debug API routes removed
- [x] Console.log statements cleaned up
- [x] Temporary scripts with hardcoded credentials removed
- [x] Error handling without exposing internal details
- [x] Content consistency between authenticated and anonymous users

## Access Control Summary
- **Anonymous users**: Can read all content, cannot edit
- **Authenticated non-admins**: Can read all content, cannot edit
- **Authenticated admins**: Can read and edit all content
- **New signups**: Must provide correct invite code to become admin

## Next Steps for Production
1. Add rate limiting to API endpoints
2. Implement content audit logging
3. Add HTTPS enforcement
4. Configure proper CORS policies
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
6. Regular security updates and dependency checks
